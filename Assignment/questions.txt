1. Write code that would display:
  a. A random decimal from 0 to 1 (exclusive)
  b. A random decimal from 0 to 10 (exclusive)
  c. A random integer from 0 to 1000 (inclusive)
  d. A random decimal from 5 to 15 (exclusive)
  e. A random integer from 1 to 3 (inclusive)
  f. A random integer from 100 to 150 (inclusive)

2. Convert each statement to a boolean expression. Come up with variables to represent each value.
  a. You can eat if you have food and you are hungry
  b. You can swim if it is Monday or Friday and the pool sign says "open"
  c. You get pizza if it is friday or saturday and your Math mark is above 80 or you did your chores.

3. Identify the logic errors in the statements below, which should display a single appropriate message for any value of age:

  if (age < 18) {
    console.log("child");
  } else if (age > 18 && age < 65) {
    console.log("adult");
  } else if (age > 65) {
    console.log("senior");
  }

4. Given the following assignments, determine if each of the following expressions evaluates to true or false:

  size = 100 weight = 50 value = 75

  a) size > 50 && weight == 50
  b) value < 100 && !(weight == 50)
  c) size >= 100 || value >= 100
  d) weight < 50 || size > 50
  e) !(value < 75)
  f) !(size > 100 && weight >50 && value > 75)
  g) (value < 125 || weight < 76) & size == 100

5. Look up the Math library documentation (Google JavaScript Math Library) to help you answer the following:
  a) Write a statement that will calculate y to the power of x.
  b) Write a statement that will calculate the absolute value of y.
  c) Write a statement that will calculate the square root of y.

6. Determine if each of the following are true or
false. If false, explain why.
  a) The condition of an if statement must be a Boolean expression.

  b) A nested if statement and an if-else if
  statement are the same.

  c) A compound Boolean expression can contain more than two Boolean expressions.

  d) In a logical AND expression, both operands
  must be true for the expression to evaluate
  to true.

  e) In logical expressions, && is evaluated before !.

7. Write a small program that asks the user for a number between 0 and 100. Output either "Thanks!" (if the number is 0-100) or "Incorrect Value" (if the number is outside the range). Use a logical operator in your if-statement (&& or ||)

8. Write a small program that asks the user for a color. If they enter a color of the rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, or violet), say "That's a rainbow color!". Otherwise, say "Color submitted.".  You may NOT use an else-if in your answer.

9. Write a small program that asks the user to enter a single digit odd number and a 2-digit even number. If they enter correctly, output the sum of those numbers. Otherwise, tell them "You didn't follow the instructions."  Use a logical operator in your if-statement (&& or ||)

10. Write a small program that creates three random integers from 0 to 100 and outputs them. If at least 2 of these numbers are above 50, output "Lucky!". Otherwise, output "Unlucky...".
E.g. 20 32 99 Unlucky...
E.g. 45 65 55 Lucky!
E.g. 67 89 76 Lucky!
